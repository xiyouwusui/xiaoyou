/// Resolves the chat composer's bottom padding and keyboard spacer from raw
/// per-frame window metrics, keeping the composer's absolute screen position
/// monotone while the soft keyboard hides and perfectly still once settled.
///
/// Raw metrics are not trustworthy frame-by-frame on every device:
/// - `viewPadding.bottom` can momentarily report 0 or a stale value while
///   the IME animates or the navigation mode changes (observed on ColorOS),
///   which makes any formula based on the live value settle the composer too
///   low and visibly pop it up when the hide animation ends.
/// - `viewInsets.bottom` can emit a short non-zero blip right after the hide
///   animation has settled at 0, which re-engages the keyboard spacer for a
///   frame and bounces the composer.
///
/// Guards 1-3 are provably inert on healthy signals; guard 4 reshapes only
/// the tail of the hide trajectory:
/// 1. Rest latch: `viewPadding.bottom` is latched while the keyboard is
///    fully closed and the latched value anchors the rest position during
///    keyboard motion.
/// 2. Rest floor: the composer's total distance from the physical screen
///    bottom (SafeArea padding + bottom padding + spacer) never drops below
///    the latched rest position. The healthy lifted trajectory always stays
///    at or above it, so the floor only engages on degraded signals and on
///    unfocused dismissals (where it pins the composer exactly at rest for
///    the whole hide animation).
/// 3. Settle debounce: when the inset rises right after settling, the lift
///    is deferred by one frame so single-frame inset blips are swallowed. A
///    real keyboard open only loses its first sub-perceptual frame (~2dp).
/// 4. Continuous landing: while the keyboard is closing, the total is
///    capped at `max(rest, inset + clearance)`. The raw formulas would hold
///    the composer clearance-height above rest for the last stretch of the
///    hide (a flat shelf) and only drop the final ~10dp in the very last
///    frames — which reads as a small bottom bounce after an apparent
///    landing. With the cap the composer rides the keyboard down in one
///    continuous motion, lands exactly at rest slightly before the keyboard
///    finishes, and never moves again. The opening trajectory is untouched.
