///
/// Two signals cooperate:
/// - `hasInputIntent` (focus or editing) is the continuous truth: while it is
///   true, the composer should be lifted, full stop. This handles the steady
///   state (focused field with the IME open, focused field after a back-press
///   that hides the IME but keeps focus, focused field tapped to re-show the
///   IME).
/// - `arm()` latches the lift across transient focus loss, e.g. focus blips off
///   for a frame or two while the IME is opening on devices with degraded
///   focus signals. The latch survives `hasInputIntent` going false until the
///   IME is observed clearly closing, has settled closed, or never came up at
///   all within the opening grace window.
